# Description

NEVER use `<img>` element in a Next.js project.

Using the `<img>` element can result in slower Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and higher bandwidth usage, as it lacks the optimizations provided by the `<Image />` component from next/image. Next.js’s `<Image />` automatically optimizes images by serving responsive sizes and using modern formats, improving performance and reducing bandwidth.

If your project is self-hosted, ensure that you have sufficient storage and have installed the sharp package to support optimized images. When deploying to managed hosting providers, be aware of potential additional costs or usage.
