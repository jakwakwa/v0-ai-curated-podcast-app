const _curateText = `**Key Features & How They Benefit You:**

- **One Focused Bundle Per User:** To ensure the highest quality of your personalised episodes and to manage the significant costs associated with advanced AI processing (like ElevenReader), each user can now manage one primary collection at a time. This focus allows us to dedicate our resources to creating one truly exceptional weekly episode for you.
- **Effortless Show Selection:** We offer two intuitive ways for you to build your perfect collection:
    - **Editor's Choice Shows:** Our team handpicks a selection of approximately 25 high-quality podcast shows. You have the flexibility to choose up to 5 individual shows from this curated list to form your custom collection. Your interests can change, and so can your collection – you'll be able to easily add or remove shows at any time.
    - **Pre-curated Bundles:** For ultimate convenience, we've created three special "Editor's Choice" bundles. Each bundle is a thoughtfully assembled package of 5 shows centred around a specific theme (e.g., "Tech Weekly," "Business Insights," "Science & Discovery"). If you opt for a bundle, its contents are expertly chosen and fixed, meaning you can't edit the individual shows within it. These bundles will be refreshed monthly by our team to ensure the content remains relevant and exciting.
- **Automated Weekly Episodes – Delivered to You:** This is where the magic happens! Once your collection is set up, PodSlice will automatically generate a brand-new, single podcast episode for you every week. This process operates on a precise schedule, with a set cut-off time (e.g., every Friday at midnight). Our system will gather the latest content from your selected shows and intelligently summarise it into a cohesive, engaging episode.
- **Stay Informed with Smart Notifications:** You'll always know when your fresh episode is ready. We're implementing a robust notification system designed for your convenience:
    - **In-App Alerts:** A clear on-screen notification (like a bell icon) will appear within the app to let you know your new episode is waiting.
    - **Weekly Email Reminders:** A helpful email will be sent out weekly, reminding you about your newly generated podcast episode and encouraging you to listen.
    - **Personalised Preferences:** You'll have full control over your notification preferences in your account settings, allowing you to tailor how and when you receive updates.
- **Your Episodes, Always Accessible:** Should you decide to remove a collection, rest assured that any episodes previously generated from it will remain accessible in your "all podcast episodes" view. Your listening history is always preserved.`;
